This research report offers a snapshot of the presence of women in STEM in universities and the workforce in Mexico. It uses data from a labor market survey and college administrative records to outline the main challenges that women who study or work in STEM faced between 2012 and 2021 and offers some policy suggestions on how to address these issues.

I was the main author of this research report, which analyzes ten years of data from household surveys and administrative records on college enrollment to describe how the gender gap in STEM subjects and occupations begins in childhood and grows until it comes to shape women's professional careers.
